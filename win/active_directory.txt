ACTIVE DIRECTORY

Active Directory domains are named using the Domain Name System (DNS) namespace.
You can group domains that are part of the same contiguous DNS namespace
within the same domain tree. For example, the marketing.adatum.com, sales.adatum.
com, and adatum.com domains are part of the adatum.com domain tree.

all the domains within the forest trust each
other, whereas separate forests, by default, do not have any trust relationships set up

with Windows Server 2003 and newer
versions, you can use a trust type called a cross-forest trust to create a single transitive
trust between two forest root domains. This single trust allows all of the domains in
both forests to fully trust one another.

Forests are considered the security boundary
in Active Directory; by this we mean that if you need to definitively restrict access to a
resource within a particular domain so that administrators from other domains do not
have any access to it whatsoever, you need to implement a separate forest instead of
using an additional domain within the current forest. This security concern is due to
the transitive trust relationship that exists between all domains in a forest, the writable
naming contexts (NCs) that exist on all domain controllers in a forest, and the extensive
rights and permissions that are granted to members of the Administrators group.

Domain controllers are servers that host an Active Directory domain and provide authentication
and directory services to clients.
