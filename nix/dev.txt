Unix Device and File I/O
/dev
	-allows programs to access devices themselves
	--directory in standard unix filesystem architecture for handling device i/o
/sys
	-used to view information and manage devices
	--(virtual) filesystem

device files (file handles) interfacing with hardware are found in the /dev directory
ls -asl /dev
	> brw-rw----   1 root disk	9,	0 May 9 22:33 sda
	  ^-first bit on each line describes type of file
	  b - block
		-device that transfers data in large fixed-sized blocks
		--e.g. hard raw disk interfaces, disk partitions, formatted filesystems
	  c - character
		-device that transfers data, but only one character concurrently
		--most psudo devices (e.g. /dev/null) are character devices
	  p - pipe
		-named pipes allow two or more processes to communicate with each other
		--transfer data at a rate of one character character concurrently, but -unlike character-type devices- instead of having output sent to a device, it's sent to another process
	  s - socket
		-facilitates communication between processes
		--transfers data at a rate of one character (one 8-bit hex byte) concurrently, but -unline named pipes- transfers data to many devices simultaneously instead of outputting to only one process
	  > brw-rw----   1 root disk	8,	0 May 9 22:33 sda
									^-major device type
										^-minor device type
		major device number
			-represents device driver that is used
		minor device number
			-kernel which unique device it is in this driver class
				--case 0 represents first device (a, sda)

SCSI Devices
	-Small Computer System Interface
	--pronounced ("scuzzy")
	-protocol for communication between different device types
	--represented by prefix sd (SCSI disk)
	/dev/sda
	/dev/sda1
pseudo devices
	--devices which are not really physically connected to the machine, but they allow operating system some additional functionality
	--generally emulate character devices
	/dev/null
		-accepts and discards all input
		--null output
	/dev/random
		-produces pseudorandom number block
	/dev/urandom
		-produces pseudorandom number stream
	/dev/zero
		-accepts and discards all input
		--produces a continuous stream of NULL bytes
PATA Devices
	-Parallel ATA devices
	--used in some legacy systems
	--represents disk drives with hd prefix
	/dev/hda
	/dev/hda1
	
sysfs
	-manages on system outside of /dev directory file i/o structure
	-virtual filesystem, mounted to the /sys directory
	/sys
		--more verbose information than than /dev file i/o
		--contains all the information for all devices on system
	ls -a /sys/block/sda

udev
	--prior to udev:
		mknod /dev/sdb1 b 8 3
			-create device node
		rm /dev/sdb1
	-udev system dynamically creates and removes device files depending on whether or not they are actively system connected
	udevd daemon
		--listens for messages from the kernel about devices connected to the system
		--parse device information from kernel match the data with the rules that are specified in /etc/udev/rules.d
			--creates device nodes and symbolic links for devices
	udevadm
		--program to view udev database and sysfs
	udevadm info --query=all --name=/dev/sda
