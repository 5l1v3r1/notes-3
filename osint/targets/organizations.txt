Organization/Forest/Domain Owner Profiling

Shared VHost enumeration
	"IP Neighbors"


DNS Records & whois/reverse whois & dns lookup
	--see dns osint notes files
	-to enumerate organization search fields
		whois:
			unique information:
			Registrant Organization
			Admin Organization
			Tech Organization
			potentially correlated information:
			Registrar
			Create Date
			Expires Date
		DNS:
			SOA records email
			CNAME records (forwarding)
			A/AAAA records
				--records pointing to same IP Address(es)
			NS Records
				--check for organizational nameserver registration (for Domain/Forest)
			TXT Records
				--manually check txt records for org-relevant information
				--correlate unique shared records
				--SPF records
					--check for included mx domains other than shared Apex Domain
	--Historcal data, e.g. dnsdumpster/security trails/&c, often contains temporal metadata; correlating first seen dates or (better) first-last seen/duration dates (especially common for organizations who deploy PaaS/IaaS-hosted applications/infrastructure) between record types or linked to other attributes can indicate co-deployment or organization-wide roleout schedules; though this can be a false positive for very high level providers (though such providers will be visible in record data)
