CORS Attacks

Overview:
1.Web client sends a request for some resource hosted on an external domain
2.Web application responds to that request with some content
3.Web client processes some web application response
	-if a web client(e.g. browser)-managed Origin header can be manipulated the Origin request HTTP header may be supplied some arbitrary value to force the web application to provide the target arbitrary data
	-in other cases not otherwise directly accessable content on an internal network may be requested by an attacker providing arbitrary Origin/Referer header information


RELEVANT HEADERS
Request:
Host
Origin
Referer
Response:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin


Case 1:
Response: -
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
	-A wildcard value for any Access-Control-Allow-Origin indicates a vulnerability (insecure configuration)
	--all domains are allowed to access the server response
	
	
Case 2:
Request: -
Referer: https://arbitr.ary/
Origin: https://arbitr.ary/
Response: -
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://arbitr.ary/
	-Referer or Origin values are sometimes reflected in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response value
	--any arbitrary domain is then allows to access the server response
