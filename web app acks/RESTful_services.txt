>How are sessions authenticated and handled?
	*NOTE: Authentication is one of the most primary and in my experience commonly exploitable functions in RESTful APIs
	**which in no suggests the most common Authentication vulnerabilities are easy to exploit; though they should be easy to find instances of during source code review,
	**since most instances of insecure authentication are the result of non-cryptographic or weak cryptographic PRNGs and hashing algorithms (calls to standard libraries)
	**or in many cases dependant on easily reversible encodings (JWT, base64 obfuscation elsewhere) for secrecy
	authentication should be handled by a centralized IdP (Identity Provider); IdP issues authentication tokens
		-are issued tokens sufficiently complex and random?
			test for unpredictability
				-generate and collect many auth tokens, are there any noticeable patterns in generated tokens?
			-tool: Burp Sequencer
		is a pseudorandom number generator or hashing function used to generate token values?
			-pseudorandomly generated tokens:
				is a cryptographic pseudorandom number generation algorithm used?
					-vulnerabilties include backtracking (resistence) and prediction (resistance)
						--backtracking resistence: previously generated bits should be impossible to recover; prediction resistence: future bits should be impossible to predict
					check with statistical analysis
						-count the number of 1 bits versus the number of 0 bits OR the distribution of 8-bit patterns
							--measure of entropy
						--passing statistical analysis tests does not preclude cryptographic security
							--it is possible to design cryptographically insecure/weak PRNGs that will in most cases pass statistical analysis testing even with large sample sets
					to ensure normaly in the result set of auth tokens, compare them with a result set obtained for a reliable sample of equal size:
						> openssl rand <# bytes> --out outfile.ext
					Mersenne Twister (MT) is the most commonly implemented non-cryptographic PRNG, check against known MT patterns if generation seems weak/patterned
						--default PRNG for: C++ (in standard lib since C++11), C++ BOOST, PHP, Python, Ruby, R
						consists in an internal state (S) consisting of 624 32-bit words
						Ssub(k+624) = Ssub(k+397) ^ A((Ssub(k) & 0x80000000) | (Ssub(k+1) & 0x7fffffff))
							-*note: algorithm never combines two bits of S together, only operates on bits of S with constants & (bitwise AND) and | (bitwise OR)
							-ergo: any future state can be expressed as a bitwise XOR combination of bits from the the initation array state Ssub(1)...Ssub(624)
							--e.g. Ssub(228+624)=Ssub(882) can be expressed as a function of Ssub(625), Ssub(228) and Ssub(229), Ssub(625) by expression in terms of Ssub(398), Ssub(1) and Ssub(2)
							--ergo converse is subsequently true: bits fron the initial state cab be expressed as a an XOR of output bits
					-problem is linear insecurity, algorithm involves operation on only single bits, linear combinations of those bits include max 624 variables
					-non-linear algorithms also include products (&[AND]-combinations) of bits, which with some same seed allows for up to 2^264 variables
					--java.util.Random() and Math.random() in java standard libraries are also commonly used and insecure/weak
					types of cryptographically secure PRNGs (CSPRNG):
						stream cipher
						block cipher
						CSPRNGs by design, e.g. algorithms Yarrow-160 or its improved derivitive Fortuna
						combination PRNGs, combining several PRNG algorithm privimitives sufficient to remove the detectable non-randomness of each given primitive
			hashing function-derived algorithms
				check random-looking values for patterns matching cryptographic hashes
					-tool: https://github.com/psypanda/hashID
					-tool: https://code.google.com/archive/p/hash-identifier/
					does the parameter or context of the response body indicate what the format of the hash value may be?
						-can MASK a PRINCE rule be written to brute force the plaintext message given a hash value?
					does tampering with the hashed value return errors?
						-appending escape characters or sending invalid values (e.g. wrong length or charset for submitting where a hash is expected) return errors
					does the applications produce valid responses if hashed values replaced with arbitrary valid hash values computed by an attacker
						-are arbitrary values sent to the server within computed hash values processed by the server?
							-are those values stored in session variables, a filesystem (is stored data serialized?) or database?
							-will a message containing escape sequences that is computed to a hashed value be processed as a sequence escaping into operation?
								-SSTI?
								*any system doing this will depend upon a (likely relatively small) fixed number of pre-computed hashed message values
		-test for other paramater modifications to recieve session tokens without properly authenticating
	access control decision should be taken locally by REST endpoints
		can any requests be directly accessed?
				--do any of these constitute information disclosure vulnerabilties?
			prior to or without authentication?
			redirecting to an authentication page?
				does the resulting url for the authentication page contain an open redirect?
		-test for parameter modification if direct access is forbidden
	Is BASIC AUTH in use?
		APIs should support standard AUTH (JWT, OAUTH, &c)
	Deriving session identification from cookies or headers (or local/sessionStorage)
		What parts of the Session ID are static?
			What portions of the Session ID are static for replicated authentication conditions?
		What information can be deduced from the structure of the Session ID?
			What patterns are present in Session ID struture and/or within (possibly even between) derivative partial structures  
		What sensetive information is stored in the Session ID?
	Does the authentication function have a max retry limit?
>JWT (JSON WEB TOKENS)
	-string composed by 3 parts separated by a "."
		header
			-JOSE header (JSON Object Signing and Encryption header)
			-metadata that describes which algorithm is used for signature and/or encryption
		payload
			-contains data that can be serialized to a JSON string
		signature
			-used to by server to ensure confidentiality and verify integrity of payload
	--each part can be encoded using base-64
		echo $jwtstring | base64 -d
	--can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA
		echo -n "value" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "key"
	Unsecure JWT
		--not protected by a signature or MAC
			{"alg":"none"}
		-unsecured JWT are simple base64-encoded strings
		-can the signature or MAC be brute-forced?
		*signatures should be preferred over MACs for integrity protection
			--a random complicated key should be in use to make brute forcing a JWT resource-intensive
	Is the algorithm extracted from the payload?
		-If MACs are used for integrity protection, every service that is able to validate JWTs can also create new JWTs using the same key
			--ergo: all services using the same key have to mutually trust each other
			--ergo: compromise of any service also compromises all other services sharing the same key
		-algorithm should be forced on the backend (preferably HS256 or RS256)
		What algorithms are considered insecure?
			HMAC keys shorter than 256 bits
			AES keys shorter than 128 bits
			 RSA keys shorter than 1024 bits
	Does a relying party or token consumer validate JWT by verifying its integrity and claims contained
		--this is the most secure configuration
		-else may rely on the information of the JWT header to select the verification algorithm
			--this is an insecure configuration
	Standard Claims that should be verified:
		'iss' or issuer - is this a trusted issuer? Is it the expected owner of the signing key?
		'aud' or audience - is the relying party in the target audience for this JWT?
		'exp' or expiration time - is the current time before the end of the validity period of this token?
		'nbf' or not before time - is the current time after the start of the validity period of this token?
	Does a decoded JWT contain any information that should not be or is redundantly stored on the client system?
		Is this sensitive information?
		-only the server should know the "secret" that is used to generate the JWT
			--if data contained in JWT is modified, server should fail to decode it
	How long does the token live?
		-TTL or RTTL should be as short as possible
		tokens with long lifespans may allow csrf attacks or may be returned to an attacker in an xss payload
	Where is the JWT stored?
		-JWT stored in client browser LocalStorage can be returned via DOM interaction and is made especially vulnerable with weak CORS policies
	Can the JWT ever be sent over unecrpyted/plaintext HTTP?
		-an MitM and/or MitB attack forcing HTTP downgrade can trivially intercept token if sent over plaintext
		--unlike cookies, JWT cannot be flagged as 'http-only' or 'secure'
			--only limited to defined origin and attacks impeded by potential SOP violation
	Cracking 'secure' JWT tokens
		--what's needed to brute force?
		Token
			-HS256 JWT Token
		Alphabet
			-alphabet to use for brute force attempt
			--character array of all values to iterate over
			"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"
		--expect 20-60mins to crack using high-end desktop (i9-9800X (Skylake-X architecture, 10core/20thread [3.5GHz])) complex high entropy token; 40-100mins using high-end laptop (i7-9850H (Coffee Lake-H architecture, 6core/12thread [2.6GHz])) CPU-based brute force

>OAUTH
	Is redirect_uri validated on the server-side?
		-only whitelisted URLs should validate
		Can the IP be spoofed using an arbitrary X-Forwarded-For: Header value?
		OAUTH open redirect example exploit:
			http://target.dom/endpoint?redir=http://attacker.dom/target.dom
	Does OAUTH exchange for code or token?
		-always prefer code over tokens
			--don't allow response_type=token
	Is the state parameter used with a random hash on the OAuth authentication process?
		-else CSRF attacks may be possible
	Are the default scope and validate scope parameters defined for each application?
	Replay attacks?
	Session fixation?
	XML Signature wrapping?
>SSO
	--single sign on
	
>API Keys
	Is the API key required for every request to each protected endpoint?
	Is HTTP response code 429 "Too Many Requests" ever returned while rapidly making requests?
	Is an API key revocation functionality in place?
		-does it strictly comply with application's usage agreement?
>SSL
	Is the application also hosted as plaintext?
	Is the HSTS header sent in HTTP responses?
	Is certificate-pinning enabled for the FQDN?
>IDOR
	(Insecure Direct Object Reference)
	*common to find endpoints that don't perform authorization checks that should
		e.g. /something/api/v1/service_name/users/666/
		*GET Requests may allow access to sensetive user information
		*POST requests are more likely to allow manipulating user information
	-out of range index errors are fairly common given a an integer value
		--e.g. /path/to/endpoint/666 where index item 666 is uninitialized, thus Null
		--may return verbose respones containing source code or revealing backend framework, data storage system, &c
