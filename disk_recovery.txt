Physical Storage (HDD/SSD) Recovery
	-Most software-based solutions also relevant to recovering virtualized disks (VHD/VMDK/whatever, largely format-agnostic in this context)

RECOVERY DISKS
GParted
	-"GNU Parted"
	--bootable recovery optical disk image (.iso)
	--best option for the heavy lifting
		--convenient to mount disk on eSATA/USB device and directly connect it to a virtual machine
			--VMWare significantly preferable for this specific use case
	--(see section "LINUX" (below))


LINUX
fsck
	--standard utility
ddrescue
	https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/
	apt-get install ddrescue ddrescueview ddrutility gddrescue
	ddrescue-GUI
		https://www.hamishmb.com/html/downloads.php?program_name=ddrescue-gui
gpart
	--scans drives and attempt re-create partition table of specified device based on "guesses"
	gpart /dev/sda


Windows
cmd.exe
	"hard disk corrupt or unreadable"
chkdsk
	-checkdisk
	--attempts to repair file system errors, locate bad sectors, and recover readable information from those bad sectors
	chkdsk e: /r
		-run chkdsk on an entire volue
		-/r -locate bad sectors and recover information from them
			--assumes /f flag
		-/f -fix errors
		--if chkdsk cannot lock the disk, will prompt to run the command the next time you restart Windows
	chkdsk c:\Users\yourname\path\to\corrupted.file
		--run chkdsk on only a corrupted file
	chkdsk /spotfix
	chkdsk /scan
sfc
	-system file checker
		--scan and fix windows system files
	sfc /scannow
		-perform an immediate scan of system and replace files as necessary
		--if errors found, reboot likely required for internal (boot) disks
	sfc /verifyfile=c:\windows\system32\kernel32.dll
	sfc /scanfile=d:\windows\system32\kernel32.dll /OFFBOOTDIR=d:\ /OFFWINDIR=d:\windows /OFFLOGFILE=c:\log.txt
	sfc /scanonce
		-schedule to perform scan next time system is restarted
	sfc /scanboot
		-schedules a scan to be performed on every system boot
	sfc Revert
		-return System File Checker to its default settings

DISM
	-Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
	--DISM enumerates, installs, uninstalls, configures, and updates features and packages in Windows images. The commands that are available depend on the image being serviced and whether the image is offline or running.
