SSTI
	Server Side Template Injection
	
	--vulnerabilities can occur when the template engine parses or interprets user-supplied data
	--template engines often include a method for calling functions
		--in most templating enginges this makes server-side code execution, command injection or client-side HTML injection/xss possible
	
Attack Vectors
	return dynamic, potentially sensitive information, in response body
		--e.g. application configuration data, included files or user information
	code injection
		--excute functions in the language implementing the template engine
	command execution
		--execute commands on the host operating system
	expression language injection
		--expression language used to create server-side templates
		--expression language vulnerabilties not strictly inject vulnerabilities
