STACK
	-grows down(to lower memory addresses) the address space
FILO (first-in, last-out) ordering
	-first item put into a stack is the last item to come out/off (be returned from) the stack
	--ideal for storing transitory information (like local variables)
	pushing -adding an item to the stack
	popping -removing an item from the stack
HEAP
	-grows up(to higher memory addresses) the address space
	-data is removed from and added to the heap as it grows
FIFO (first-in, first-out) ordering
	-(~)first item put onto the heap is the first item to come off
Big Endian 0x12345678 -Most significant byte is stored first for 4-byte words
Little Endian 0x78563412 -Least significant byte is stored first for 4-byte words
