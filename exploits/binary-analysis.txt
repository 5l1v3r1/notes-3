Binary analysis


strings
-check for ascii-hex strings in binary (unencrypted)

ltrace
-trace through the library calls
ltrace -e strcmp
-string comparison of lib calls sometimes useful for cryptographic hash cracking

ls -ashl
-check for sgid, suid and sticky bit executables
--x, s or t: executable, setuid// setgid, or sticky
Real user id — The user id of the user who actually executed the program.
Effective user id — The user id with whose priviledge the executable is being run.
Effective user ID relevant C standard library apis:
geteuid, getruid, setreuid — For getting the effective user id, getting the real user id, and setting the real and effective user id at once, respectively.
access — For checking if the real user has access to a file. Even if the executable had the setuid flag set, it’d check the priviledges of the real uid, not the effective uid.
