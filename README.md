####How To Read This Document:
	The documents contained herein are merely my non-redacted personal notes taken over the course of several years as a penetration tester/security consultant/application security engineer with initial documents originally written while working through the PWK (Pentesting With Kali Linux) certification course by Offensive Security. As such there syntactical and lexical conventions vary between documents and within documents over the course of their writing and editing over time. Nonetheless, the conventions being my own they tend to read fairly consistently between like documents. While generally written as reference notes and ocasionally consisting of only unannotated commands and command syntax (aplogies, again these are merely my personal notes) the included documents are often verbose and may be a useful tool in learning certain information security domains or technologies rather than acting as a simple reference document.
	
	The subjects covered herein are vast within the domain of infosec and the feedback I have received from peers with whom I've shared sections previously has been that these documents are both well-written and useful to others in the infosec community, so they are now hosted here as a public contribution to that community. As a partial supplement a number of useful or unique unredacted scripts I've written in various languages are additionally publicly available at [https://github.com/ThePacketBender/pentest_scripts](https://github.com/ThePacketBender/pentest_scripts) . Use them if and as you wish, they are, in my humble opinion, a more interesting and on a long enough timeline more useful contribution than scripted automation tools (which is not to say automation is unimportant, rather that it loses its usefulness when standardized given detection systems can easily pick up even pseudorandom repeated signatures).
	
	Updates are regular and extensive.
